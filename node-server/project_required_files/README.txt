Will be used to store dependencies that are required by jenkins, sonar, etc...

For now I will use it to store the jenkins xml file and the ckjm application, ckjm will be placed in the gitignore as dont want to push an application to version control, can be downloaded from here https://www.spinellis.gr/sw/ckjm/, unpack and place the java executable here.

Would not be much of an issue either way as its not large at all.
